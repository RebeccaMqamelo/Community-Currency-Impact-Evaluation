# The Effect of Covid-19 Lockdown on Community Currency Trade in Kenya: A Synthetic Control Analysis

This project studies how Kenyaâ€™s government-instituted lockdown aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 affected trade within the Sarafu Community Currency Network in Nairobi. Using synthetic control methods, I show that community currency users who were exposed to the lockdown display a notable increase in trade. This is despite most people having experienced a decrease in income due to the economic effects of the pandemic. These results support the argument that community currencies have higher utility when there is a greater scarcity of national currency. The contribution of this paper is to add quantitative and empirical evidence to the growing weight of research that points to community currencies as an effective counter-cyclical buffer against economic shocks.
